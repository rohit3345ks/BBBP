    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIn the description of SpriteFont+ you state\r\n_The license is totally open so feel free to use it in your commercial or personal projects, etc. No attribution necessary._\r\n\r\nIn fact the GPLv3 license you provide, is almost unusable in commercial projects. It forces me to publish my game under GPLv3 too, which means I have to publish it free and open source.\r\n\r\nWas that your intention? would you mind, publishing it under a less restrictive license, like MIT?",
